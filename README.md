This is a Purwadhika Capstone Project Module 2.

The dataset that I was provided is Airbnb Listing Bangkok

The analysis that I did is to uncover actionable insight to help listing's hosts improve their listing performance.
The analysis will address the following key questions:

**1. Geospatial Competition and Listing Density:**

How does the density and spatial distribution of listings influence competition among Airbnb hosts in various neighborhoods across Bangkok?

**2. Seasonal Trends and Pricing Strategies:**

What seasonal patterns exist in listing availability and pricing, and how can Airbnb hosts adapt their strategies to maximize occupancy throughout the year?

**3. Language and Keywords in Descriptions:**

How do the language, sentiment, and choice of keywords in listing descriptions affect booking rates, review volumes, and pricing strategies?

This analysis will equip Airbnb hosts in Bangkok with practical strategies to optimize their listings, attract more guests, and stand out in a competitive market.
